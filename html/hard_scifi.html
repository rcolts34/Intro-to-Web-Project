                                        <p class="p1_p">Hard Sci-Fi is a sub&dash;genre of science fiction that prioritizes scientific accuracy, technical precision, and a strict adherence to the laws of physics and other scientific principles</p>
                                        <p class="p1_p">Authors typically aim to present ideas and scenarios based on plausible scientific concepts, often times extrapolating from current levels of technology and scientific knowledge.</p>

During the journey, tensions rise between, the ship's crew, and HAL 9000 (a sentient AI that controls the ship's s systems).  The story raises phyilosophical requestions regarding the future of humanity without the advantage of being the only "intelligent" beings.

The selected crew members all have one thing in common; their individual dysfunctions cause them to perceive reality in otherwise impossible ways.  The story explores the Labyrinthian nature of communication and understanding between radically different forms of life.  It also delves into indindividualized perceptions of reality, epitomized by crew's leader, who can only perceive the world in non-euclidean
