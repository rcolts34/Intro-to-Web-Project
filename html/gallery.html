Clarke denied that this was intentional, stating it was a coincidence.

                                                      "Interstellar," directed by Christopher Nolan and released in 2014, is known for its stunning visuals and complex scientific themes. Here's an interesting fact about the film:
            
                                                      To ensure scientific accuracy in depicting a black hole, the filmmakers enlisted the help of theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, a Nobel laureate. Thorne provided valuable insights and equations that allowed the visual effects team to create a highly accurate representation of a spinning black hole, which came to be known as "Gargantua" in the film.

What's intriguing is that Peter Watts, the author, has a background in marine biology and is known for his scientific rigor. To create the character of Siri Keeton, Watts drew upon his own experiences as a scientist, particularly the meticulous data collection and analysis methods used in scientific research.
